    "text": "Intuition\nThe einsum can make two operations over tensors: multiplication and summation.\nWe will try to understand the mechanism on how this notation perfom these two operations.\n\nMultiplication\nLetâ€™s consider another 3x3 matrix called B. We can create a third matrix, C, which contains elements derived from the multiplication of corresponding elements in A and B.\nFor instance, c11 = a11 * b11. In general, cij = aij * bij, meaning that the value in the i-th row and j-th column of C (cij) is obtained by multiplying the i-th row and j-th column of A (aij) by the i-th row and j-th column of B (bij).\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.random.random((3, 3))\nB = np.random.random((3, 3))\n\nC = np.multiply(A, B)\nAlternatively, you can achieve the same operation using einsum notation:\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.random.random((3, 3))\nB = np.random.random((3, 3))\n\nC = np.einsum('ij,ij-&gt;ij', A, B)\nThe einsum notation structure resembles cij = aij * bij, as shown below:\ncij = aij * bij\nnp.einsum(â€˜ij,ij-&gt;ijâ€™, A, B)\nThis structure follows a specific pattern: first, you specify indices for each of your inputs separated by commas (we have two inputs: A and B), as in â€˜ij,ijâ€™. Then, you add an arrow to indicate the beginning of the output definition (-&gt;). Finally, you add the indices of the outputs, in this case, â€˜ijâ€™. Overall, it appears as â€˜ij,ij-&gt;ijâ€™. Einsum performs the multiplication of corresponding elements (aij and bij in this case).\nWe can also understand the einsum notation by thinking in terms of for loops:\nC = np.zeros((3,3))\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        C[i, j] = A[i, j] * B[i, j]\nNow, letâ€™s consider another example where we multiply the vector v = [1, 2, 3] element-wise by the vector p = [4, 5, 6] using einsum notation.\nThinking in terms of math notation, we would have zi = vi * pi.\nUsing einsum:\nv = np.array([1, 2, 3])\np = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n\nz = np.einsum('i,i-&gt;i', v, p)\nIn our for-loop analogy:\nv = np.array([1, 2, 3])\np = np.array([4, 5, 6])\nz = np.zeros(3)\nfor i in range(3):\n  z[i] = v[i]*p[i]\nNow, letâ€™s explore what happens when we use â€˜i,jâ€™ instead of â€˜i,iâ€™ in the einsum notation for our vectors v and p:\nIn this scenario, we introduce one index for vector v (denoted as i) and another index for vector p (denoted as j). The einsum operation will perform element-wise multiplication, combing each element of v with every element of p.Â \nConsider vector v with a size of 3 and vector p with the same size of 3. When we use â€˜i,jâ€™ in einsum, we end up with 9 possible combinations: v0 * p0, v0 * p1, v0 * p2, v1 * p0, v1 * p1, v1 * p2, v2 * p0, v2 * p1, and v2 * p2.\nThe einsum operation organizes these combinations into a 3x3 matrix, where each element cij corresponds to the product of vi and pj.\nTo illustrate this with a for loop analogy:\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(3):\n        c[i, j] = v[i] * p[j]\nIn einsum notation, we would write:\nnp.einsum('i,j-&gt;ij', v,p)\n\n\nSummation"
